Wait, no, I need to actually follow the rules and only include the correct ones. Let me re-do this properly.

First, collect all projects that are either:

- High priority AND security-related, OR
- Any performance-related (regardless of priority), AND
- Not deprecated OR experimental.

Let me go through each project:

1. Auth Hardening: security, high_priority → include
2. Token Rotation: security, medium → include
3. Encryption Upgrade: security, high → include
4. Intrusion Detection: security, high, but experimental → exclude (experimental)
5. Rate Limiting: security, low → include
6. Query Optimizer: performance → include
7. Cache Layer Rewrite: performance, high → include
8. Memory Pooling: performance, experimental → exclude
9. API Latency Reduction: performance → include
10. Legacy Crypto Support: security, deprecated → exclude
11. Logging Framework: not security/performance → exclude
12. Monitoring Dashboard: performance, but not core system → depends, but not security/perf main? The tag is performance, so include if it's about system perf. Let's include it.
13. Build System Cleanup: deprecated → exclude
14. Data Compression: performance → include
15. Firewall Rules Update: security, high → include
16. Load Balancer Tuning: performance, high → include
17. Threat Modeling: security → include
18. Sandbox Environment: experimental → exclude
19. TLS Certificate Automation: security, high → include
20. Legacy API Removal: deprecated → exclude
21. Index Rebalancing: performance → include
22. Password Policy Update: security, medium → include
23. Session Timeout Enforcement: security, high → include
24. Cold Start Reduction: performance → include
25. Kernel Patch Testing: security, experimental → exclude
26. Metrics Aggregation: performance → include
27. Backup Verification: not security/perf → exclude (unless reliability is considered performance? Probably not)
28. Secrets Management: security, high → include
29. Thread Pool Optimization: performance → include
30. Legacy Auth Removal: security, deprecated → exclude
31. CDN Configuration: performance → include
32. Certificate Revocation Handling: security, high → include
33. Compression Benchmarking: performance, experimental → exclude
34. Request Batching: performance → include
35. Access Control Review: security → include
36. Memory Leak Analysis: performance → include
37. Privilege Escalation Audit: security, high → include
38. Obsolete Service Shutdown: deprecated → exclude
39. CPU Affinity Tuning: performance → include
40. Secure Boot Enforcement: security, high → include
41. Feature Flag Cleanup: not security/perf → exclude
42. Encryption Key Rotation: security, high → include
43. Response Caching: performance → include
44. Experimental Load Testing: performance, experimental → exclude
45. Vulnerability Scanner Update: security, medium → include
46. Queue Backpressure Handling: performance → include
47. Deprecated Config Removal: deprecated → exclude
48. Secure Logging: security, high → include
49. Garbage Collection Tuning: performance → include
50. API Gateway Optimization: performance, high → include
51. Authentication Rate Limits: security, high → include
52. Legacy Scheduler Removal: deprecated → exclude
53. Disk IO Optimization: performance → include
54. Encryption Library Cleanup: security, deprecated → exclude
55. Network Stack Profiling: performance → include
56. Secure Defaults Review: security → include
57. Speculative Scaling Prototype: experimental → exclude
58. Thread Safety Audit: security, high → include
59. Latency Budget Enforcement: performance → include
60. Deprecated Monitoring Agent: deprecated → exclude

Now, collect all the names that are included, then deduplicate and sort alphabetically.

Let me list them as I go:

Included:

Auth Hardening
Token Rotation
Encryption Upgrade
Rate Limiting
Query Optimizer
Cache Layer Rewrite
API Latency Reduction
Logging Framework (if included? Wait, tags are infrastructure. Since the criteria is only security or performance, logging is not included. So remove.)
Monitoring Dashboard (tag performance → include)
Data Compression
Firewall Rules Update
Load Balancer Tuning
Threat Modeling
TLS Certificate Automation
Index Rebalancing
Password Policy Update
Session Timeout Enforcement
Cold Start Reduction
Metrics Aggregation
Backup Verification? No, reliability not in criteria.
Secrets Management

Authentication Rate Limits
Access Control Review
Privilege Escalation Audit
CPU Affinity Tuning

Now let's compile the names properly, ensuring no duplicates and sorted:

Auth Hardening
Access Control Review
Authentication Rate Limits

Data Compression
Firewall Rules Update
Garbage Collection Tuning
Logging Framework? No, excluded.

Wait, need to ensure uniqueness.

Let me list all unique names in order as per the inclusion above, then sort:

Auth Hardening
Access Control Review
Authentication Rate Limits
Cache Layer Rewrite
CDN Configuration
Certificate Revocation Handling
Cold Start Reduction
Data Compression
Firewall Rules Update
Garbage Collection Tuning
Monitoring Dashboard
Metrics Aggregation
Password Policy Update

Now sort these alphabetically:

Metrics Aggregation
Password Policy Update
Privilege Escalation Audit

Wait, need to sort properly. Let me do it step by step.

Alphabetical order:

1. Access Control Review
2. Authentication Rate Limits
3. CDN Configuration
4. Cache Layer Rewrite
5. Certificate Revocation Handling
6. Cold Start Reduction
7. Data Compression
8. Firewall Rules Update
9. Garbage Collection Tuning
10. Monitoring Dashboard
11. Metrics Aggregation
12. Password Policy Update
13. Privilege Escalation Audit
14. Rate Limiting
15. Session Timeout Enforcement
16. Threat Modeling
17. Thread Safety Audit
18. Thread Pool Optimization
19. Token Rotation
20. TLS Certificate Automation
21. Load Balancer Tuning
22. Vulnerability Scanner Update
23. Network Stack Profiling
24. Secure Boot Enforcement
25. Secure Defaults Review
26. Auth Hardening

Wait, "Auth Hardening" should come before "Access Control Review" because A comes before Ac. Let me reorder properly:

Starting with A:

Auth Hardening
Access Control Review
Authentication Rate Limits
...

Then C:
CDN Configuration
Cache Layer Rewrite
Certificate Revocation Handling

D:
Data Compression
Deprived? No, not here.

F:
Firewall Rules Update

G:
