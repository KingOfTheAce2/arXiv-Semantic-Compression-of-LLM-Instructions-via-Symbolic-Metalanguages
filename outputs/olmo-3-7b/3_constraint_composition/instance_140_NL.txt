Wait, no, I need to actually follow the rules and only include the correct ones, sorted alphabetically, as a JSON array of strings. Let me re-do this properly.

First, collect all projects that meet the criteria:

Include if:
- tagged security AND high_priority
OR
- tagged performance (any priority)

Exclude if:
- tagged deprecated OR experimental

Let me go through each project (number and name):

1. Auth Hardening – security, high_priority → include
2. Token Rotation – security, medium → no (not high)
3. Encryption Upgrade – security, high → include
4. Intrusion Detection – security, high, but experimental → exclude
5. Rate Limiting – security, low → include (performance not tagged but security? Wait, no: Rate Limiting is security? The tags say "security" yes. So since it's security, regardless of priority, include unless deprecated/experimental. It's low priority but still security → include
6. Query Optimizer – performance → include
7. Cache Layer Rewrite – performance, high → include
8. Memory Pooling – performance, experimental → exclude
9. API Latency Reduction – performance → include
10. Legacy Crypto Support – security, deprecated → exclude
11. Logging Framework – not security/performance → no
12. Monitoring Dashboard – performance, but not core criteria (infrastructure) → no (not security or performance tagged)
13. Build System Cleanup – deprecated → exclude
14. Data Compression – performance → include
15. Firewall Rules Update – security, high → include
16. Load Balancer Tuning – performance, high → include
17. Threat Modeling – security → include
18. Sandbox Environment – experimental → exclude
19. TLS Certificate Automation – security, high → include
20. Legacy API Removal – deprecated → exclude
21. Index Rebalancing – performance → include
22. Password Policy Update – security, medium → include (since security)
23. Session Timeout Enforcement – security, high → include
24. Cold Start Reduction – performance → include
25. Kernel Patch Testing – security, experimental → exclude
26. Metrics Aggregation – performance → include
27. Backup Verification – not tagged → no
28. Secrets Management – security, high → include
29. Thread Pool Optimization – performance → include
30. Legacy Auth Removal – security, deprecated → exclude
31. CDN Configuration – performance → include
32. Certificate Revocation Handling – security, high → include
33. Compression Benchmarking – performance, experimental → exclude
34. Request Batching – performance → include
35. Access Control Review – security → include
36. Memory Leak Analysis – performance → include
37. Privilege Escalation Audit – security, high → include
38. Obsolete Service Shutdown – deprecated → exclude
39. CPU Affinity Tuning – performance → include
40. Secure Boot Enforcement – security, high → include
41. Feature Flag Cleanup – not security/performance → no
42. Encryption Key Rotation – security, high → include
43. Response Caching – performance → include
44. Experimental Load Testing – performance, experimental → exclude
45. Vulnerability Scanner Update – security, medium → include
46. Queue Backpressure Handling – performance → include
47. Deprecated Config Removal – deprecated → exclude
48. Secure Logging – security, high → include
49. Garbage Collection Tuning – performance → include
50. API Gateway Optimization – performance, high → include
51. Authentication Rate Limits – security, high → include
52. Legacy Scheduler Removal – deprecated → exclude
53. Disk IO Optimization – performance → include
54. Encryption Library Cleanup – security, deprecated → exclude
55. Network Stack Profiling – performance → include
56. Secure Defaults Review – security → include
57. Speculative Scaling Prototype – experimental → exclude
58. Thread Safety Audit – security, high → include
59. Latency Budget Enforcement – performance → include
60. Deprecated Monitoring Agent – deprecated → exclude

Now collect all the included names, then sort alphabetically and deduplicate (in case of duplicates, but I don't see any here).

List of included project names (unsorted):

Intrusion Detection – no, excluded
Wait, no, Intrusion Detection was excluded. So skip that.

Wait let me recheck the list again to ensure I didn't include any excluded ones. For example, I had to exclude Intrusion Detection (experimental), Kernel Patch Testing (experimental), Sandbox Environment (experimental), Legacy API Removal (deprecated), etc. So the above list should be correct.

Continuing the sorted list:

Wait the list again step by step:

Starting from A:
