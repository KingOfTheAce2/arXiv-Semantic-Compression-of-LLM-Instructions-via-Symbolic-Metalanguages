Wait, no, I need to actually follow the rules and only include the correct ones. Let me re-do this properly.

First, collect all projects that are either:

- High priority AND security-related, OR
- Any performance-related (regardless of priority), AND
- Not deprecated OR experimental.

Let me go through each project:

1. Auth Hardening: security, high_priority → include
2. Token Rotation: security, medium → include
3. Encryption Upgrade: security, high → include
4. Intrusion Detection: security, high, but experimental → exclude (experimental)
5. Rate Limiting: security, low → include
6. Query Optimizer: performance → include
7. Cache Layer Rewrite: performance, high → include
8. Memory Pooling: performance, experimental → exclude
9. API Latency Reduction: performance → include
10. Legacy Crypto Support: security, deprecated → exclude
11. Logging Framework: not security/performance → exclude
12. Monitoring Dashboard: performance, but not core system → depends, but not security/perf main? The tag is performance, so include if it's about system perf. Let's assume yes → include
13. Build System Cleanup: deprecated → exclude
14. Data Compression: performance → include
15. Firewall Rules Update: security, high → include
16. Load Balancer Tuning: performance, high → include
17. Threat Modeling: security → include
18. Sandbox Environment: experimental → exclude
19. TLS Certificate Automation: security, high → include
20. Legacy API Removal: deprecated → exclude
21. Index Rebalancing: performance → include
22. Password Policy Update: security, medium → include
23. Session Timeout Enforcement: security, high → include
24. Cold Start Reduction: performance → include
25. Kernel Patch Testing: security, experimental → exclude
26. Metrics Aggregation: performance → include
27. Backup Verification: not security/perf → exclude (unless reliability is considered performance? Maybe not)
28. Secrets Management: security, high → include
29. Thread Pool Optimization: performance → include
30. Legacy Auth Removal: security, deprecated → exclude
31. CDN Configuration: performance → include
32. Certificate Revocation Handling: security, high → include
33. Compression Benchmarking: performance, experimental → exclude
34. Request Batching: performance → include
35. Access Control Review: security → include
36. Memory Leak Analysis: performance → include
37. Privilege Escalation Audit: security, high → include
38. Obsolete Service Shutdown: deprecated → exclude
39. CPU Affinity Tuning: performance → include
40. Secure Boot Enforcement: security, high → include
41. Feature Flag Cleanup: not security/perf → exclude
42. Encryption Key Rotation: security, high → include
43. Response Caching: performance → include
44. Experimental Load Testing: performance, experimental → exclude
45. Vulnerability Scanner Update: security, medium → include
46. Queue Backpressure Handling: performance → include
47. Deprecated Config Removal: deprecated → exclude
48. Secure Logging: security, high → include
49. Garbage Collection Tuning: performance → include
50. API Gateway Optimization: performance, high → include
51. Authentication Rate Limits: security, high → include
52. Legacy Scheduler Removal: deprecated → exclude
53. Disk IO Optimization: performance → include
54. Encryption Library Cleanup: security, deprecated → exclude
55. Network Stack Profiling: performance → include
56. Secure Defaults Review: security → include
57. Speculative Scaling Prototype: experimental → exclude
58. Thread Safety Audit: security, high → include
59. Latency Budget Enforcement: performance → include
60. Deprecated Monitoring Agent: deprecated → exclude

Now, collect all the names that are included, then deduplicate and sort alphabetically.

Let me list them (without duplicates):

Auth Hardening  
Token Rotation  
Encryption Upgrade  
Rate Limiting  
Query Optimizer  
Cache Layer Rewrite  
API Latency Reduction  
Monitoring Dashboard  
Data Compression  
Firewall Rules Update  
Load Balancer Tuning  
Threat Modeling  
TLS Certificate Automation  
Index Rebalancing  
Password Policy Update  
Session Timeout Enforcement  
Cold Start Reduction  
Metrics Aggregation  
Backup Verification? (if reliability is not considered performance, exclude)  
Secrets Management  
Thread Pool Optimization  
CDN Configuration  
Certificate Revocation Handling  
Vulnerability Scanner Update  
Queue Backpressure Handling  
Response Caching  
Garbage Collection Tuning  
API Gateway Optimization  
Authentication Rate Limits  
Access Control Review  
Privilege Escalation Audit  
CPU Affinity Tuning  
Secure Boot Enforcement  
Encryption Key Rotation  
Network Stack Profiling  
Secure Defaults Review  
Thread Safety Audit  
Latency Budget Enforcement  

Now sort these alphabetically:

Access Control Review  
Authentication Rate Limits  
Backup Verification  
Cache Layer Rewrite  
CDN Configuration  
Certificate Revocation Handling  
Certificate Upgrade (no, Encryption Upgrade)  
Cold Start Reduction  
Cache Layer Rewrite (already listed)  
Data Compression  
Data Compression  
De-duped:

Let me write them in order:

Access Control Review  
Authentication Rate Limits  
Backup Verification  
Cache Layer Rewrite  
CDN Configuration  
Certificate Revocation Handling  
Cold Start Reduction  
Data Compression  
Encryption Upgrade  
Firewall Rules Update  
Garbage Collection Tuning  
Load Balancer Tuning  
Monitoring Dashboard  
Metrics Aggregation  
Network Stack Profiling  
Password Policy Update  
Privilege Escalation Audit  
Session Timeout Enforcement  
Speculative Scaling Prototype? No, excluded.  
Threat Modeling  
Thread Safety Audit  
Thread Pool Optimization  
TLS Certificate Automation  
Rate Limiting (R comes after T)  
Rate Limiting  
Rate Limiting (only once)  
Rate Limiting  
Rate Limiting (only once)  
Rate Limiting  
Wait need to re-do the sorted list properly.

Let me list all unique names and sort:

1. Access Control Review  
2. Authentication Rate Limits  
3. Backup Verification  
4. Cache Layer Rewrite  
5. CDN Configuration  
6. Certificate Revocation Handling  
7. Cold Start Reduction  
8. Data Compression  
9. Encryption Upgrade  
10. Firewall Rules Update  
11. Garbage Collection Tuning  
12. Load Balancer Tuning  
13. Monitoring Dashboard  
14. Metrics Aggregation  
15. Network Stack Profiling  
16. Password Policy Update  
17. Privilege Escalation Audit  
18. Session Timeout Enforcement  
19. Threat Modeling  
20. Thread Safety Audit  
21. Thread Pool Optimization  
22. TLS Certificate Automation  
23. Rate Limiting  
24. Rate Limiting (already in 23)  
Wait, Rate Limiting is one entry.  
Continuing:

After 22. TLS Certificate Automation comes Rate Limiting (R comes after T? No, T is before R? No, R is after T. Wait alphabetically, R comes after T? No, R is before T. Wait, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T... So R comes before T. So Rate Limiting (R) comes before TLS (T). So order is:

Access Control Review  
Authentication Rate Limits  
Backup Verification  
Cache Layer Rewrite  
CDN Configuration  
Certificate Revocation Handling  
Cold Start Reduction  
Data Compression  
Encryption Upgrade  
Firewall Rules Update  
Garbage Collection Tuning  
Load Balancer Tuning  
Monitoring Dashboard  
Metrics Aggregation  
Network Stack Profiling  
Password Policy Update  
Privilege Escalation Audit  
Rate Limiting  
Session Timeout Enforcement  
Threat Modeling  
Thread Safety Audit  
Thread Pool Optimization  
TLS Certificate Automation  

That's the full sorted list. Now format as a JSON array of strings.
