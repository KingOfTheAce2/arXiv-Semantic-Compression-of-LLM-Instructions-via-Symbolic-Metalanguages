Wait, no, I need to actually follow the rules and only include the correct ones. Let me re-do this properly.

First, collect all projects that are either:

- High priority AND security-related, OR
- Any performance-related (regardless of priority), AND
- Not deprecated OR experimental.

Let me go through each project:

1. Auth Hardening: security, high_priority → include
2. Token Rotation: security, medium → include
3. Encryption Upgrade: security, high → include
4. Intrusion Detection: security, high, but experimental → exclude (experimental)
5. Rate Limiting: security, low → include
6. Query Optimizer: performance → include
7. Cache Layer Rewrite: performance, high → include
8. Memory Pooling: performance, experimental → exclude
9. API Latency Reduction: performance → include
10. Legacy Crypto Support: security, deprecated → exclude
11. Logging Framework: not security/performance → exclude
12. Monitoring Dashboard: performance, but not core system → depends, but not security/perf main? The tag is performance, so include if it's about system perf. Let's assume yes → include
13. Build System Cleanup: deprecated → exclude
14. Data Compression: performance → include
15. Firewall Rules Update: security, high → include
16. Load Balancer Tuning: performance, high → include
17. Threat Modeling: security → include
18. Sandbox Environment: experimental → exclude
19. TLS Certificate Automation: security, high → include
20. Legacy API Removal: deprecated → exclude
21. Index Rebalancing: performance → include
22. Password Policy Update: security, medium → include
23. Session Timeout Enforcement: security, high → include
24. Cold Start Reduction: performance → include
25. Kernel Patch Testing: security, experimental → exclude
26. Metrics Aggregation: performance → include
27. Backup Verification: not security/perf → exclude (unless reliability is considered performance? Maybe not)
28. Secrets Management: security, high → include
29. Thread Pool Optimization: performance → include
30. Legacy Auth Removal: security, deprecated → exclude
31. CDN Configuration: performance → include
32. Certificate Revocation Handling: security, high → include
33. Compression Benchmarking: performance, experimental → exclude
34. Request Batching: performance → include
35. Access Control Review: security → include
36. Memory Leak Analysis: performance → include
37. Privilege Escalation Audit: security, high → include
38. Obsolete Service Shutdown: deprecated → exclude
39. CPU Affinity Tuning: performance → include
40. Secure Boot Enforcement: security, high → include
41. Feature Flag Cleanup: not security/perf → exclude
42. Encryption Key Rotation: security, high → include
43. Response Caching: performance → include
44. Experimental Load Testing: performance, experimental → exclude
45. Vulnerability Scanner Update: security, medium → include
46. Queue Backpressure Handling: performance → include
47. Deprecated Config Removal: deprecated → exclude
48. Secure Logging: security, high → include
49. Garbage Collection Tuning: performance → include
50. API Gateway Optimization: performance, high → include
51. Authentication Rate Limits: security, high → include
52. Legacy Scheduler Removal: deprecated → exclude
53. Disk IO Optimization: performance → include
54. Encryption Library Cleanup: security, deprecated → exclude
55. Network Stack Profiling: performance → include
56. Secure Defaults Review: security → include
57. Speculative Scaling Prototype: experimental → exclude
58. Thread Safety Audit: security, high → include
59. Latency Budget Enforcement: performance → include
60. Deprecated Monitoring Agent: deprecated → exclude
