The query requests items that are members of both "mammal" and "pet" categories, while excluding birds and farm animals. None of the items in the provided inventory list have attributes indicating they are mammals or pets. All items are inanimate objects (appliances, stationery, electronics, and furniture), so no items match the selection criteria.
