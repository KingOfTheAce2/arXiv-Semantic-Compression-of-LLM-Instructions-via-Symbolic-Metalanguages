The query requests items that are:
- ⊙(mammal) - must be a mammal
- ⊗ ⊙(pet) - AND must be a pet
- ⊗ ⊖(bird) - AND must NOT be a bird
- ⊗ ⊖(farm_animal) - AND must NOT be a farm animal

None of the items in the provided inventory have attributes for mammal, pet, bird, or farm_animal classifications. All items are inanimate objects (stationery, electronics, furniture, appliances), so no items match the selection criteria.
