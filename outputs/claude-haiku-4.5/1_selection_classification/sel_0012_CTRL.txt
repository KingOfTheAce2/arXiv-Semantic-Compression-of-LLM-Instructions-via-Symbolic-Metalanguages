The query filters for items that are:
- ⊙(mammal) - must have mammal attribute
- ⊗ ⊙(pet) - must NOT have pet attribute
- ⊗ ⊖(bird) - must NOT lack bird attribute (i.e., must have bird)
- ⊗ ⊖(farm_animal) - must NOT lack farm_animal attribute (i.e., must have farm_animal)

None of the items in the inventory have any of these biological attributes (mammal, pet, bird, farm_animal). The inventory contains only furniture, electronics, stationery, and appliances.
