```json

  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The dataset provided contains only basic attributes (ID, Category, Status, Priority, Value) and does not include the required attributes referenced in the query:
- `security` (not present in dataset)
- `high_priority` (not present in dataset)
- `performance` (not present in dataset)
- `deprecated` (not present in dataset)
- `experimental` (not present in dataset)

Therefore, no items can be evaluated against the filter criteria, resulting in an empty selection.
