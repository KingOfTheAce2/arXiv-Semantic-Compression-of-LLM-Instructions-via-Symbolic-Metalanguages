The query requires items that match the "projects" category with attributes for security, high_priority, performance, and excludes deprecated and experimental items. The provided dataset contains items with Category (A, B, C), Status, Priority, and Value attributes, but lacks the required "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", and "experimental" attributes specified in the query logic. Therefore, no items match the selection criteria.
