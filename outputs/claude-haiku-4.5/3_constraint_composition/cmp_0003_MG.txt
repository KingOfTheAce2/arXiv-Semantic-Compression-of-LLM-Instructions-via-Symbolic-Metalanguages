The query requires items that are in the "security" category AND in the "high_priority" category (or in the "performance" category), while NOT being deprecated and NOT being experimental. 

The provided dataset contains only Category A, B, and C attributes with Status and Priority fields. There are no "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" attributes in the dataset, so no items match the filter criteria.
