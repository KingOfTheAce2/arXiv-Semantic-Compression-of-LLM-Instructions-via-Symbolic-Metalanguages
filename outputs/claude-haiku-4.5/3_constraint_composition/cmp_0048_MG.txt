```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query filters for projects that match:
- `(security ∩ high_priority) ∪ performance` AND
- `¬deprecated` AND
- `¬experimental`

The provided dataset contains items with only these attributes: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value. There are no attributes for "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental", so no items match the filter criteria.
