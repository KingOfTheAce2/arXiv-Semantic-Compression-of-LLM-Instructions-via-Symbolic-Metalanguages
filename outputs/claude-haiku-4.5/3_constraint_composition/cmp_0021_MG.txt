The query requires items that match:
- `∈(security) ∩ ∈(high_priority) ∪ ∈(performance)` AND
- `¬(deprecated)` AND
- `¬(experimental)`

The provided dataset contains only attributes: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value. There are no attributes for "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" in the dataset. Therefore, no items can be matched against these criteria.
