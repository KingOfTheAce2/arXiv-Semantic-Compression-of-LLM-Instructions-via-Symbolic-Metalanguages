**Explanation:** The query requires items that are in the "security" category AND/OR in "high_priority" AND/OR in "performance" category, while excluding deprecated and experimental items. However, the dataset provided contains only Category (A, B, C), Status, Priority, and Value attributes. There are no attributes matching "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" in the input data. Therefore, no items match the filter criteria.
