```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that simultaneously have:
- security attribute (⊙) - NOT PRESENT in dataset
- high_priority attribute (⊙) - NOT PRESENT in dataset
- performance attribute (⊙) - NOT PRESENT in dataset
- NOT deprecated (⊖) - NOT PRESENT in dataset
- NOT experimental (⊖) - NOT PRESENT in dataset

Since the dataset contains only Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes, and none of the required attributes (security, high_priority, performance, deprecated, experimental) exist in the data, no items match the filter criteria.
