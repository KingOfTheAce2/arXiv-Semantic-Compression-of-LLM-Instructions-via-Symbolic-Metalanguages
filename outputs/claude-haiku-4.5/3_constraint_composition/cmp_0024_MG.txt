  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0

```

The query requires items that match:
- `∈(security) ∩ ∈(high_priority) ∪ ∈(performance)` - must be in security AND high_priority OR in performance
- `¬(deprecated)` - not deprecated
- `¬(experimental)` - not experimental

The provided dataset contains only: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. There are no "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" attributes present in any items, so no items match the filter criteria.
