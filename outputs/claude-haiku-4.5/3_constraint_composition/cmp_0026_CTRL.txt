```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that simultaneously have:
- security attribute (⊙(security))
- high_priority attribute (⊙(high_priority))
- performance attribute (⊙(performance))
- NOT deprecated (⊖(deprecated))
- NOT experimental (⊖(experimental))

The provided dataset contains only: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. None of the required attributes (security, high_priority, performance, deprecated, experimental) exist in the dataset, so no items match the filter criteria.
