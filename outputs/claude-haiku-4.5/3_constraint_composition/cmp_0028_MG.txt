The query filters for projects that match specific security and priority criteria with exclusions for deprecated and experimental status. However, the provided dataset contains items with only Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. There are no attributes mapping to:
- `security` 
- `high_priority`
- `performance`
- `deprecated`
- `experimental`

Therefore, no items can be evaluated against the specified conditions, resulting in an empty selection.
