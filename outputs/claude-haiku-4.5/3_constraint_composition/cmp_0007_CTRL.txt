```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that have ALL of the following attributes:
- security: ⊙(security)
- high_priority: ⊙(high_priority)
- performance: ⊙(performance)
- NOT deprecated: ⊖(deprecated)
- NOT experimental: ⊖(experimental)

The provided dataset contains only: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. None of the required attributes (security, high_priority, performance, deprecated, experimental) are present in the data, so no items match the filter criteria.
