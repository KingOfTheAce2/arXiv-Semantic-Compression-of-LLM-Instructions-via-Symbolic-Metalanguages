The query requires items that simultaneously have attributes "security", "high_priority", and "performance", while excluding items marked as "deprecated" or "experimental". The provided dataset contains only Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. None of the required attributes (security, high_priority, performance) are present in the dataset, so no items match the filter criteria.
