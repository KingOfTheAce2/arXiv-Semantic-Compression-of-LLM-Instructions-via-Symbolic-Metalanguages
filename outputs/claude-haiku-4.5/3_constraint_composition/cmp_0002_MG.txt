```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that match:
- `∈(security) ∩ ∈(high_priority) ∪ ∈(performance)` (must have security AND high_priority, OR performance attribute)
- AND `¬(deprecated)` (not deprecated)
- AND `¬(experimental)` (not experimental)

The provided dataset contains only: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. There are no "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" attributes present in any items, so no items match the filter criteria.
