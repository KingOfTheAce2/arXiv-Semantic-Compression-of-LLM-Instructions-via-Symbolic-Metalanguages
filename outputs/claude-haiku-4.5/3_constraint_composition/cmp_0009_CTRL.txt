```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that simultaneously have:
- security attribute (⊙)
- high_priority attribute (⊙)
- performance attribute (⊙)
- NOT deprecated (⊖)
- NOT experimental (⊖)

The provided dataset contains only: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. None of the required attributes (security, high_priority, performance, deprecated, experimental) are present in the data, so no items match the filter criteria.
