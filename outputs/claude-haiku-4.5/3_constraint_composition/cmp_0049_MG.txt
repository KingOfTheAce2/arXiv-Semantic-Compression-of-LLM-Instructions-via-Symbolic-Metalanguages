```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that match:
- `∈(security) ∩ ∈(high_priority) ∪ ∈(performance)` - must have "security" AND "high_priority" attributes OR "performance" attribute
- `¬(deprecated)` - must not be deprecated
- `¬(experimental)` - must not be experimental

The provided dataset contains only: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. There are no "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" attributes present in any items, so no items match the filter criteria.
