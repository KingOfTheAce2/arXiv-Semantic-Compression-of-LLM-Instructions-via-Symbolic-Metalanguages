```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items to have attributes matching the conditions for "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", and "experimental" - none of which exist in the provided dataset. The dataset only contains: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. Therefore, no items can be selected.
