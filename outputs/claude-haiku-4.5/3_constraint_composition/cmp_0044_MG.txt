The query filters for projects that match specific criteria (security, high_priority, performance attributes and absence of deprecated/experimental flags), but the provided dataset contains items with only Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. None of the items have the required "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" attributes specified in the filter expression, so no items match the criteria.
