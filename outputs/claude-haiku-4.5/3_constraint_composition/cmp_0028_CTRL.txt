```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that match ALL of these conditions:
- ⊙(security) - has security attribute
- ⊙(high_priority) - has high_priority attribute
- ⊙(performance) - has performance attribute
- ⊖(deprecated) - does NOT have deprecated attribute
- ⊖(experimental) - does NOT have experimental attribute

The provided dataset contains only: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. None of the items have the required "security", "high_priority", or "performance" attributes, so no items match the filter criteria.
