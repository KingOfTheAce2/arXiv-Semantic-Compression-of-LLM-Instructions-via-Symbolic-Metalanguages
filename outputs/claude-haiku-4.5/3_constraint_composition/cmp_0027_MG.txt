```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query filters for items that are:
- In security AND high_priority OR in performance (no items have these attributes in the dataset)
- NOT deprecated (no items marked as deprecated)
- NOT experimental (no items marked as experimental)

Since the dataset contains only Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes, and none of the items have "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" attributes, no items match the filter criteria.
