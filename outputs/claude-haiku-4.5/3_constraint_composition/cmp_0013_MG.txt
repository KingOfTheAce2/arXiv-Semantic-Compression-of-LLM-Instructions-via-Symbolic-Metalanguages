**Explanation:** The query requires items that match the "projects" category with attributes including "security", "high_priority", "performance", and must not be "deprecated" or "experimental". The provided dataset contains items with Category (A, B, C), Status, Priority, and Value attributes, but lacks the required "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", and "experimental" attributes specified in the query. Therefore, no items match the selection criteria.
