The query requires items that simultaneously have attributes "security", "high_priority", and "performance" (indicated by ⊙ operators), while excluding items with "deprecated" and "experimental" attributes (indicated by ⊖ operators). 

The provided dataset contains only Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. None of the required attributes (security, high_priority, performance, deprecated, experimental) are present in the data, so no items match the filter criteria.
