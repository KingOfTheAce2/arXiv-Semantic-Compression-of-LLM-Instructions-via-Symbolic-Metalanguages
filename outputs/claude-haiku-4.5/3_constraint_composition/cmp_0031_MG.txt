The query filters for projects that match specific criteria (security, high_priority, performance, not deprecated, not experimental), but the provided dataset contains items with only Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. There are no attributes matching "security", "high_priority", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" in the dataset, so no items satisfy the filter conditions.
