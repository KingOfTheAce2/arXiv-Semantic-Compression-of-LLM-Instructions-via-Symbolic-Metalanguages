```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that simultaneously have:
- security attribute (⊙(security))
- high_priority attribute (⊙(high_priority))
- performance attribute (⊙(performance))
- NOT deprecated (⊖(deprecated))
- NOT experimental (⊖(experimental))

None of the items in the dataset have these attributes defined. The dataset only contains: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. Therefore, no items match the filter criteria.
