```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that match ALL of the following conditions:
- Have "security" attribute (⊙(security))
- Have "high_priority" attribute (⊙(high_priority))
- Have "performance" attribute (⊙(performance))
- Do NOT have "deprecated" attribute (⊖(deprecated))
- Do NOT have "experimental" attribute (⊖(experimental))

The provided dataset contains only: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. None of the required attributes (security, high_priority, performance, deprecated, experimental) are present in any item, so no items match the filter criteria.
