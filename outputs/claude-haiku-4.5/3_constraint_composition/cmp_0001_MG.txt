```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query filters for projects that match:
- `∈(security) ∩ ∈(high_priority) ∪ ∈(performance)` (must have security AND high_priority, OR have performance)
- AND `¬(deprecated)` (not deprecated)
- AND `¬(experimental)` (not experimental)

The provided dataset contains items with only Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. There are no attributes matching "security", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" in any of the items, so no items satisfy the filter criteria.
