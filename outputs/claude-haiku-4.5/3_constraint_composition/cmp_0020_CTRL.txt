```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that simultaneously have:
- security attribute (⊙)
- high_priority attribute (⊙)
- performance attribute (⊙)
- NOT deprecated (⊖)
- NOT experimental (⊖)

None of the items in the dataset have these attributes defined. The dataset only contains: ID, Category, Status, Priority, and Value fields. Therefore, no items match the filter criteria.
