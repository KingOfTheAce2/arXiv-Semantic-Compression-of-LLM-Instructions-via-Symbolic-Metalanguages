The query requires items that are in the "security" category AND/OR in "high_priority" AND/OR in "performance" category, while excluding deprecated and experimental items. However, the dataset provided contains only Categories A, B, and C with Status and Priority attributes. There are no items with "security", "high_priority", or "performance" categories as specified in the filter criteria, nor are there any "deprecated" or "experimental" status values to exclude. Therefore, no items match the selection criteria.
