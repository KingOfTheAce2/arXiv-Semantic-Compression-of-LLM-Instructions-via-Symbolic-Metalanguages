The dataset provided contains only items with categories A, B, and C, and statuses of pending, active, or inactive. The instructions reference criteria for "security," "performance," "deprecated," and "experimental" - none of which are present as attributes in the dataset. Therefore, no items meet the specified inclusion criteria, and the result is an empty selection.
