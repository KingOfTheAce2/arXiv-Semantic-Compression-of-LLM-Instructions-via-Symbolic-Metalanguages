```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

**Explanation:** The query requires items that simultaneously satisfy:
- Must have: security AND high_priority AND performance (all three required)
- Must not have: deprecated OR experimental

The provided dataset contains only basic attributes (Category, Status, Priority, Value) and lacks the required attributes (security, high_priority, performance, deprecated, experimental). Therefore, no items match the filter criteria.
