```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that have ALL of the following attributes:
- security (not present in dataset)
- high_priority (not present in dataset)
- performance (not present in dataset)
- NOT deprecated (not present in dataset)
- NOT experimental (not present in dataset)

Since the dataset contains only Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes, and none of the required attributes (security, high_priority, performance, deprecated, experimental) exist in the data, no items match the filter criteria.
