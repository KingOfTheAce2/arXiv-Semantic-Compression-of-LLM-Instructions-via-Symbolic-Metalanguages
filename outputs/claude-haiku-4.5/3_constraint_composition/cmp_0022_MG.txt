```json
{
  "selected_ids": [],
  "count": 0
}
```

The query requires items that match:
- `∈(security) ∩ ∈(high_priority) ∪ ∈(performance)` - must have security attribute AND high priority, OR have performance attribute
- `¬(deprecated)` - must not be deprecated
- `¬(experimental)` - must not be experimental

The provided dataset contains only Category, Status, Priority, and Value attributes. There are no "security", "performance", "deprecated", or "experimental" attributes in any of the items, so no items match the filter criteria.
